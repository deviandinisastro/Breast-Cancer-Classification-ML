# Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning
##
## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:
- Accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on feature values.
- Compare different machine learning models and select the best-performing one.
- Analyze feature importance to understand which tumor characteristics contribute the most to predictions.
