# Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning
This project is developed as part of my portfolio for Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 - Data Science by Dibimbing. I am using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset from scikit-learn, which is a classic and widely used binary classification dataset. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric predictive attributes and a target variable indicating whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1). The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models to accurately classify breast tumors using **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithms. You can access the dataset through this link: https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:
- To build and evaluate machine learning models for classifying breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.
- To identify the most important features that contribute to the classification.
- To determine the best-performing model based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- To provide insights into the dataset and model performance for potential clinical use.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following:
- 569 instances (samples) with 30 features:
Mean values of tumor characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.).
- Standard errors of these features.
--Worst values (largest or most severe) of these features.
- Target variable:
-- 0: Malignant (dangerous/cancerous tumors).
-- 1: Benign (non-dangerous/non-cancerous tumors).
