# Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning
This project is developed as part of my portfolio for Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 - Data Science by Dibimbing. I am using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset from scikit-learn, which is a classic and widely used binary classification dataset. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric predictive attributes and a target variable indicating whether a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1). The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models to accurately classify breast tumors using **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithms. You can access the dataset through this link: https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can:
- Accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on feature values.
- Compare different machine learning models and select the best-performing one.
- Analyze feature importance to understand which tumor characteristics contribute the most to predictions.
